TODO
====

- Rest of DDTP ddt.cgi (just for fun really, but mostly so it's templated so
  people can restyle it.

- Forgotten password procedure/Change password procedure

- Translation logging

  People would like to keep the comments and logs of translation
  indefinitely.  Also, people would like to see the comment of the previous
  translation when it comes up again.  Will need schema changes.

- Suggestions

  Need to work out exactly how these are imported in the first place.

- Wordlists

  Needs a new table

- Mail parsing

- Rationalise the whole milestones stuff. It's a bit half baked here and
  there.
